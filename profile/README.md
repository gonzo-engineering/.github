## The Web Is Decadent and Depraved

Gonzo Engineering is a project devoted to building free, open source tools for the benefit of journalists, musicians, and other members of the freak kingdom. It is guided by the idea that technology should work in support of keen minds - not instead of them.

Ventures so far:

- **[teeline.online](https://teeline.online)**, an interactive learning site for Teeline shorthand
- **[Soli](https://github.com/gonzo-engineering/soli)**, a 'just add water' toolkit for building musician websites

Support the development of these tools and more by [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/frederickobrien) or [becoming a backer on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/gonzo-engineering). It all adds up.
